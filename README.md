2. Title:- Develop an Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout and Dynamic Theme Switching

3. Defined Approach:-

In this experiment, an admin dashboard was developed using modern front-end web technologies with a focus on simplicity and clarity.

The layout of the dashboard was created using CSS Grid, which allows the page to be divided into structured sections such as a sidebar, header, and main content area. This grid-based approach ensures a clean and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.

To manage themes efficiently, CSS variables were used to define colors for background, text, panels, and borders. Two sets of values were created: one for light mode and another for dark mode. Switching between themes is achieved by toggling a CSS class that overrides these variables.

A JavaScript-based theme toggle was implemented using a button in the header section. When the user switches the theme, the selected preference is stored in the browser using localStorage. On every page reload, JavaScript checks the stored value and automatically applies the previously selected theme, ensuring persistence.

This approach keeps the code simple, readable, and modular while fulfilling all the experiment objectives, including responsive layout design, dynamic theme switching, and theme persistence.

4. Learning Outcomes:-

Design and implement a grid-based responsive layout using CSS Grid.

Apply CSS variables effectively for managing multiple visual themes.

Implement dynamic light and dark mode switching using JavaScript.

Utilize localStorage to persist user preferences across browser sessions.
